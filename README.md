# ðŸŒ— Theme Toggle â€“ HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project is a simple and beginner-friendly **Theme Toggle** web page that lets users switch between **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode** using a button. It's built using plain **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** with clean and responsive design.

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

1. The page initially loads with the `light` theme.
2. Clicking the **"Toggle Theme"** button triggers JavaScript, which:
   - Adds/removes `.dark` and `.light` classes on the `<body>`
3. CSS styles apply based on the current theme class.
